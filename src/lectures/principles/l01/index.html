                    <p>All we learn about astrophysical objects has been been deduced from the light that arrives at
                        our telescopes. But first, that light must travel from the object to us, passing through
                        space, our atmosphere, and the telescope before we can record an image. In this lecture we
                        look at how that journey affects what we can observe, how well we can observe it, and what
                        we expect to see in our images.</p>

                    <p>Before the light even reaches Earth, it has to travel through space. Space is not empty, and
                        the light travels through sparse dust and gas which absorbs and scatters the light. This
                        <a href="#extinction">interstellar extinction</a> both reduces and reddens the light which
                        arrives at Earth. Before the light reaches our telescopes, it has to pass through Earth's
                        atmosphere. This has a number of undesirable consequences.

                    <p>Dust particles and molecules in the atmosphere scatter and absorb the light. This
                        causes a dimming and reddening, known as atmospheric extinction, to distinguish it
                        from interstellar extinction.</p>

                    <p>The amount of dimming depends upon the local conditions in the atmosphere at the
                        time of observation. It also depends on the angle of the object above the horizon
                        (see {% figref "atmos" %}). An object observed near the horizon is observed
                        through a larger column of air, and suffers greater extinction</p>

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>The extinction also depends strongly on the wavelength of the light (see {% figref "atmos_lambda"
                        %}). This is
                        because the molecular absorption is strongly wavelength dependent. Below about 300nm,
                        ultraviolet and X-ray light are absorbed by N2, O2 and O3 molecules. This makes the
                        atmosphere totally opaque. The atmosphere is largely transparent (little absorption) in the
                        optical region (between 300 and 900 nm). In the majority of the infrared region, absorption
                        from H20, CO2 and O2 makes the atmosphere opaque, with the exception of some narrow
                        wavelength regions in the near-infrared. The atmosphere is largely transparent to radio
                        waves. At long wavelengths, however, reflection of radio waves by free electrons in the
                        ionosphere makes the atmosphere opaque once again.</p>

                    <p>As a result, the ground-based astronomer is limited to observing in the optical, in radio
                        waves, or in a few small wavelength regions in the near-infrared. Optical light is a narrow
                        region of the electromagnetic spectrum, but crucial to astronomy. In this course we will
                        only concern ourselves with the techniques and principles involved in optical astronomy. For
                        a discussion of astronomical techniques at other wavelengths, see the course textbooks.</p>

                    <h4>Sky Background and Transparency</h4>
                    <p>Transparency is related to extinction. In addition to the absorption from molecules and dust
                        particles, clouds also absorb and scatter the light from astronomical objects. The amount of
                        absorption is much more variable than extinction, as clouds are blown across the field of
                        view by wind. The resulting variations in the amount of light received from an astronomical
                        object range from partial attenuation due to thin cloud, to complete obscuration by thick
                        cloud.

                        The same dust and molecules that scatter the photons from our astronomical source, also
                        scatter light from other sources (e.g street lighting, moonlight) into our telescope. The
                        molecules in the atmosphere also emit light. As a result, the night sky is not black, but
                        acts as a noisy background to the light detected from astronomical objects. The sky
                        background can be brighter than faint stars, making the detection of faint sources
                        difficult. </p>

                    <h4>Diffraction and Resolving Power</h4>
                    <p>We have seen that the atmosphere affects the amount and colour of light that reaches us. What
                        is the effect on the quality of the images we take? To answer that question, let us pretend
                        for a moment that atmospheric turbulence does not exist, and ask what happens to the photons
                        from our object when they reach the telescope.</p>
                    <p> The resolving power (or resolution) of an astronomical telescope is a measure of its ability
                        to distinguish fine detail in an image of a source. Aberrations due to the optical design or
                        flaws in the manufacture and alignment of the optical components can degrade the resolving
                        power, as does peering through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. We shall come back to
                        address these issues in later lectures. However, even if a telescope is optically perfect
                        and is operated in a vacuum, there is still a fundamental lower limit to the resolving power
                        it can achieve. This is known as the theoretical resolving power, and in this section we
                        shall explore its origins and consequences.</p>

                    <p>{%figref "diffraction", true %} above shows a point source at infinity, i.e. a star radiating
                        light into space. Considering the light as a wave, it is possible to define wavefronts,
                        which are points of the wave at equal phase. As the wavefronts propagate from the star at
                        the speed of light, their curvature decreases until they can be considered plane-parallel
                        waves when they arrive at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. A crude analogy would be to
                        consider the waves created when a stone is thrown into the centre of a pond. Close to where
                        the stone entered the water, the wavefronts would be clearly defined circles, whereas by the
                        time they reach the edge of the pond, they would be more or less straight and parallel to
                        the edge of the pond.</p>

                    <p>In the absence of atmospheric turbulence, these plane wavefronts reach the aperture of our
                        telescope. The telescope brings the plane-parallel waves incident upon the aperture into
                        focus, forming an image of the star in the focal plane. It does this by inducing a phase
                        change on the wavefront which varies across the telescope aperture. However, since the
                        aperture does not cover the entire wavefront radiated by the star, but only a very small
                        portion of it, a diffraction pattern is produced.</p>

                    <p>The diffraction pattern produced when imaging a point source with a lens-based telescope is
                        shown in {% figref "airy" %} below. The image appears as a spot surrounded by
                        concentric rings which decrease in brightness with increasing distance from the centre. The
                        bright central spot, known as the Airy disc after the British astronomer who first studied
                        it, is theoretically predicted to contain 84% of the light, and the first ring contains less
                        than 2%.</p>

                    <p>The size of the Airy disc puts a limit on the resolving power of a telescope. According to
                        Rayleigh's criterion for resolution, two point sources are said to be just resolved when the
                        centre of one Airy disc falls on the first minimum of the other diffraction pattern. This
                        results in a 20% drop in intensity between the maxima, as illustrated in {%figref "rayleigh" %}
                        below. An expression for Rayleigh's criterion can be obtained from theory by calculating the
                        positions of minima of intensity in a point-source
                        diffraction pattern. For the first minimum, this gives \[\alpha = 1.22 \lambda / D\]
                        where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light and \(D\) is the diameter of the telescope
                        aperture. \(\alpha\) is measured in radians and is the angle subtended at the aperture by
                        the centre of the Airy disc and its first minimum in the focal plane (see {%figref "airy" %}
                        above). \(\alpha\) is commonly referred to as the theoretical resolving power or

                    <h4>Atmospheric Turbulence and Seeing</h4>
                    <p>Above, we considered what would happen if the atmosphere was not present. In fact, turbulence
                        in the atmosphere degrades the resolution of the image recorded by a telescope. The effect
                        of turbulence on images is called seeing. We shall look at the causes and effects of seeing
                        in more detail below. The turbulence also causes a variation in the brightness of an image
                        recorded by a telescope, a phenomenon known as scintillation (or, less formally, twinkling),
                        but this will not be considered further here.</p>

                    <p>It is very important not to confuse seeing and transparency. The two effects are largely
                        unrelated: in poorer seeing, the image of a star will be more blurred, but its brightness
                        will remain constant; in poor transparency, the light from a star will be dimmed but its
                        blurring will be largely unaffected.</p>

                    <p>Turbulence in the atmosphere occurs on all scales and results in adjacent pockets of air
                        with slight temperature differences between them. Since the temperature of air affects its
                        density, which in turn affects its refractive index, some rays of light from an astronomical
                        source are bent by more than others. In terms of wavefronts, the plane wavefront from a star
                        is corrugated by the atmosphere, as some parts of it are retarded in phase by more than
                        others. This is shown schematically in {%figref "turbulent_wavefronts" %} below.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cell small-10">
                    {%showfigure "turbulent_wavefronts" %}

            <!-- text -->
            <div class="grid-x grid-padding-y">
                <div class="cell">
                    <p>As before, we consider the wavefronts from the star which, by the time they reach Earth
                        form a series of plane-parallel wavefronts. When these plane wavefronts travel through
                        turbulent layers in the atmosphere, the turbulence corrugates the wavefronts.</p>

                    <p>The turbulent cells are around 10cm across, so the wavefronts produced can be thought of
                        as lots of little plane wavefronts, about 10cm in length and with different angles. They
                        are blown across our telescope aperture by the wind, and typical wind speeds mean that the
                        shape of the wavefront arriving at our telescope will change every 10 milliseconds or so.
                    </p>

                    <p>We can think about the image produced by one of these wavefronts - such as would be seen
                        in a very short exposure of a few milliseconds. It can be seen from {%figref
                        "seeing_examples" %} that the image of a star will look very different through telescopes of
                        different aperture. Small-aperture telescopes will collect portions of the wavefronts which do
                        not have many corrugations. Since straight portions of a wavefront produce diffraction-limited
                        images, the instantaneous image of a star in a small-aperture telescope (of order 10 cm, the
                        typical size of the straight portion of a wavefront) will generally appear diffraction limited,
                        as shown in the left-hand panel of {%figref "seeing_examples" %}, but the image will move
                        around on timescales of a fraction of a second. This is because the straight portions of
                        successive wavefronts have different slopes with respect to the telescope aperture and hence
                        will be focused onto different points in the focal plane. The effect of exposing for many
                        seconds or minutes then is to average out this image motion into a single blurred image of the
                        star. This is known as the seeing disc.</p>

                    <p>Large aperture telescopes (>> 10 cm) collect wavefronts with many corrugations. Each of
                        the straight portions of the wavefront are simultaneously brought to a sharp focus, but at
                        positions in the focal plane dependent on their tilts. Hence the instantaneous image
                        appears as small bright spots, or speckles, superimposed on a faint, blurred disc. The
                        effect of accumulating many such images over the course of seconds or minutes is to average
                        them out into a seeing disc similar to that seen through a small telescope. </p>

                        full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the seeing disc gives a numerical value for the seeing,
                        as shown in {%figref "seeing_disc", false, true %} The figure shows brightness
                        along a cut through the star. The value \(x_2-x_1\) is typically measured in pixels from an
                        astronomical image and then converted to arcseconds using the plate scale of the telescope.
                        Seeing as low as 0.1 arcseconds has been recorded on the Earth's surface in Antarctica. The
                        typical seeing at premier astronomical observatories, such as those found in Hawaii, Chile
                        or the Canaries, is between 0.5 and 1.0 arcseconds. The best we've recorded from the roof of
                        the Physics building in Sheffield is about 2 arcseconds!</p>

                    <h4>What to expect from telescope images</h4>
                    <p>How big are stars in astronomical images? Let us try a thought experiment, and place a
                        "typical star" very nearby. Let us assume our star is the same size as the Sun i.e \(R_{*} =
                        1 R_{\odot} = 7 \times 10^{8} m\). The nearest stars are at a distance of around 1 parsec,
                        i.e \(d = 1\) pc \(\approx 3 \times 10^{16} m\). This hypothetical star would therefore
                        subtend an angular size \(\alpha_{\rm act} = R_{*}/d = 2 \times 10^{-8}\) radians \(=
                        0.005\) arc seconds. This would be the radius of the star in our image, if diffraction or
                        seeing were not an issue.</p>

                    <p>We have seen that, in the absence of seeing, the resolution limit of a telescope of diameter
                        \(D\) is \(\alpha_{\rm resol} = 1.22 \lambda / D\). Using this formula, the diffraction
                        limit of a 12-cm diameter telescope at optical wavelengths is around 1 arc second. Instead
                        of the perfect star image we'd hope for, if we use a small telescope, we will see a
                        diffraction pattern, with a central spot that has a radius of 1 arc second. Larger
                        telescopes have higher resolving powers. A world-leading, 12-m diameter telescope has a
                        diffraction limit around 0.01 arc seconds. Therefore, even if we ignore seeing, the very
                        best telescopes in the world do not resolve nearby stars.</p>

                    <p>We cannot of course, ignore seeing. Recall that typical seeing at a good site is 0.5-1 arc
                        seconds. Suppose the seeing is 0.5". For our 12 cm telescope this is smaller than the
                        diffraction pattern, and so the blurring caused by the diffraction pattern would dominate.
                        Such an image would be diffraction limited. In such an image, the stars would look like Airy
                        discs, with sizes of 1 arc second.</p>

                    <p>For our large telescope, the seeing is much worse than the diffraction, so we would be
                        seeing limited, and would see images in which all the stellar profiles were Gaussians, with
                        a FWHM set by the seeing. </p>

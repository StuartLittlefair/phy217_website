                    <h5>Reflecting Telescope Designs</h5>
                    <h6><strong>Newtonian Reflectors</strong></h6>
                    <p>James Gregory was never able to bring his telescope design, known as the Gregorian, into
                        practical use,
                        and it is Isaac Newton who is credited with making the first working reflecting telescope in
                        1668. His
                        design, known as the Newtonian, is shown in <a href="#figure46">figure 46</a>. The Newtonian is a
                        two-mirror
                        telescope in which the first mirror in the light path, known as the primary, is a concave
                        parabola. The
                        secondary mirror has no curvature at all and is hence referred to as a flat. It simply folds the
                        light
                        through 90&deg;, placing the focal plane just outside the incoming beam. The focal ratio at the
                        Newtonian focus is typically about 5. The secondary mirror is inclined at an angle of 45&deg;
                        with
                        respect to the primary. The base of the flat is actually elliptical in shape so as to minimise
                        the size
                        of the circular shadow it casts on the primary.</p>
                    <p>Although small amateur telescopes still adopt a Newtonian configuration, visual access to the
                        focus becomes inconvenient as the telescope becomes larger, and mounting instrumentation there
                        would unbalance the telescope, as demonstrated in <a href="#figure46">figure 46</a>. Hence Newtonians are
                        rarely found in professional observatories.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Cassegrain Reflectors</strong></h6>
                    <p>In 1672, the French priest Laurent Cassegrain developed another reflecting telescope design which
                        is now named after him - the Cassegrain. This design, shown in <a href="#figure47">figure 47</a>, has
                        been adopted by the majority of the world's largest telescopes due to the convenience of
                        mounting instrumentation at the focus.</p>
                    <p>The Cassegrain telescope has a concave parabolic primary mirror like the Newtonian, but it
                        employs a convex hyperbolic secondary. This increases the focal length of the telescope and
                        reflects the beam back towards the primary, where it passes through a hole bored in the centre
                        of the mirror and comes to a focus just below it. This is a much more easily accessible focus
                        than the Newtonian, and an ideal place to mount large and heavy instrumentation. Compared to a
                        Newtonian, nothing is lost by having a hole in the primary, as this region of the mirror lies
                        under the shadow of the secondary. Moreover, because the beam is folded back on itself, it is
                        possible to have a much longer focal length telescope without a correspondingly long tube: the
                        focal ratio of a typical Cassegrain focus is 15.</p>
                    <p>Another advantage of the Cassegrain design for professional observatories is that removing the
                        secondary mirror gives access to <strong>prime focus</strong>. This is equivalent to the
                        Newtonian, and provides a much smaller focal ratio and hence larger field of view than the
                        Cassegrain focus. The wider field makes prime-focus imaging more susceptible to off-axis
                        aberrations than Cassegrain-focus imaging, hence lens-based correctors are usually required at
                        prime focus.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Ritchey-Chretien reflectors</strong></h6>
                    <p>Both the Newtonian and Cassegrain telescopes suffer from significant off-axis aberrations,
                        primarily coma. To remedy this, the American and French optical designers George Ritchey and
                        Henri Chretien jointly developed the Ritchey-Chretien telescope around 1910. The
                        Ritchey-Chretien is a modified form of the Cassegrain design, with a concave hyperbolic primary
                        and a convex hyperbolic secondary. The advantage of this design is that both spherical
                        aberration and coma are removed. Astigmatism and field curvature are also reduced, all at the
                        expense of a larger secondary mirror. The shadow of the larger secondary covers some of the
                        primary mirror. Hence the Ritchey-Chretien delivers significantly better imaging performance
                        over a wider field of view than a Cassegrain, but with a slightly lower light grasp. Due to the
                        expense of making hyperbolic mirrors, Ritchey-Chretien designs are usually only found in
                        research telescopes. The best known example of a Ritchey-Chretien telescope is the 2.4m Hubble
                        Space Telescope.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Catadioptric designs</strong></h6>
                    <p>So far, we have been considering telescopes composed of only mirrors, or only lenses. Of course,
                        it is possible to combine the two. Telescopes that use both mirrors and lenses are known as
                        catadioptric. They include the <a
                            href='http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/telescopes/phy217_tel_catadioptric.html#schmidt'>Schmidt</a>
                        telescope, built to image very large fields. The field of view of a reflecting telescopes is
                        limited by <a href='../l02/index.html#offaxis'>coma</a>
                        to tens of arcseconds. A Schmidt telescope uses lenses and spherical mirrors to image fields up
                        to tens of degrees. </p>
                    <p>Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes are a hybrid of the Schmidt and Cassegrain designs. It is not a
                        telescope you will find in major research observatories, but it is arguably the most widespread
                        design used in the amateur telescope market. A schematic of the Schmidt-Cassegrain design is
                        shown in <a href="#figure49">figure 49</a>. The 16-inch telescope on the roof of the Hicks building,
                        and the 10-inch robotic telescope, are both Schmidt-Cassegrain designs.</p>

                    <p>The great advantage of the Schmidt-Cassegrain design is that it is cheap to mass produce, thanks
                        to the use of spherical mirrors. The resulting spherical aberration is dealt with by the
                        corrector lens, a feature it borrows from the Schmidt telescope. Unlike the Schmidt telescope,
                        however, the Schmidt-Cassegrain suffers from off-axis aberrations like coma and astigmatism
                        because the corrector lens is not placed at the centre of curvature. The Schmidt-Cassegrain
                        retains one of the main advantages of the Cassegrain - a long focal length in a short tube,
                        giving a telescope which is compact and portable yet able to provide small enough plate scales
                        for detailed planetary viewing. This versatility makes them ideal for the amateur astronomy
                        market. The typical focal ratio of a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope is f/10 and they are available
                        in apertures ranging from approximately 4-16 inches. Larger apertures become impractical due to
                        the cost of manufacturing the corrector and mounting it without flexure (especially if the
                        secondary mirror is attached to it).</p>

                    <h5>Telescope Mounts</h5>
                    <p>A telescope mount must hold the telescope stably, and be able to track an object as it moves in
                        the night sky. The only type of mount available before the 1980s, and still a common mount for
                        smaller telescopes is the <strong>equatorial mount</strong>, shown in <a href="#figure51">figure 51</a>
                        below.</p>

                <div class="cell small-12 medium-6">
                    <p>The beauty of an equatorial mount is the one-to-one relationship between RA and Dec and the axes
                        of the mount. Not only does this make it easy to point at an object, this also makes it simple
                        to track the motion of an object due to the Earth's rotation by driving just the polar axis at
                        an equal angular velocity, but in the opposite direction, to the angular velocity of the Earth
                        on its rotation axis.</p>
                    <p>There are many different types of equatorial mount, described in detail for the curious in <a
                            href='http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/telescopes/phy217_tel_equatorial.html'>Vik
                            Dhillon's notes</a>. However, all share the same flaw - the polar axis must be aligned with
                        the Earth's rotation axis. This means that unless the telescope is situated at the Earth's
                        poles, the polar axis will be inclined relative to the ground, thereby creating stresses on the
                        axes which vary as the telescope moves. For large research telescopes, such as the <a
                            href='http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/telescopes/phy217_tel_equatorial.html#figure33'>3.9m
                            Anglo-Australian Telescope</a>, this makes equatorial mounts incredibly hard to build, since
                        the amount of material needed to make them rigid becomes prohibitive.</p>

                    <p>The solution to this is use an Alt-Az Mount, short for Altitude-Azimuth. As the name implies, the
                        two axes of this mount are aligned with the altitude and azimuth axes of the horizontal
                        coordinate system. The telescope is mounted on a short fork, as shown in <a href="#figure52">figure 52</a>. The great advantage of the Alt-Az mount is the telescope's center of mass is fixed above the
                        mounting point, meaning that very stable mounts can be built, even for the largest telescopes.

                    <p>Alt-Az mounts are the only choice for the largest telescopes in the world, but they are not
                        without disadvantages. For a start, tracking an object requires moving both axes of the mount,
                        unlike an equatorial mount. Moreover, the speed at which each axis must move depends on the
                        location of the object. The calculations required to move the two axes are quite complex (a
                        coordinate conversion between the equatorial and horizontal systems) and need to be performed
                        many times a second. This requires the use of a computer, but computers only became readily
                        available in the 1970's. It is for this reason that every major research telescope made since
                        the 1980's uses an alt-azimuth mount, but every telescope made before this time was mounted
                        equatorially.</p>

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>Another big disadvantage of Alt-Az mounts is that the orientation of the telescope remains fixed
                        with respect to the horizon. Since the night sky rotates around an axis which is inclined to the
                        horizon, this means the orientation of the night sky, with respect to the telescope, changes
                        over time. This effect, known as <strong>field rotation</strong>, is shown in <a href="#figure53">figure 53</a> below. Field rotation of Alt-Az mounts means that they are unsuitable
                        for amateur astro-photograpy. Professional observatories get round this problem by having a
                        <strong>field rotator</strong>, which mimics the rotation of the sky, keeping the camera
                        orientation fixed with respect to the stars.

                <h5>Observatory Locations</h5>
                <p>There no world-class optical telescopes in the UK. The reason for this is cost. The world's largest
                    telescopes cost hundreds of millions of pounds. Construction has started on the 32-m diameter E-ELT,
                    with an estimated cost of €1 billion. It makes sense to build these telescopes in the best locations
                    on Earth. None of these are in continental Europe. So what makes a site suitable for a billion Euro
                    telescope?</p>

                    <h6><strong>Seeing</strong></h6>
                    <p>Selecting a site with good <a href="../l01/index.html#seeing">seeing</a>
                        is one of the most important criteria. Lower seeing improves the spatial resolution of images.
                        Since the light from the stars is also spread out over fewer pixels, good seeing also improves
                        the signal-to-noise ratio. Seeing is caused by turbulence in the atmosphere and this has two
                        causes: heat from the ground rising through the atmosphere and strong winds higher in the
                        atmosphere (e.g the jet stream).</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere over the sea tends to be much less turbulent than the atmosphere over land, as the
                        sea exhibits an essentially smooth, constant-temperature surface compared to the land. Some of
                        the best astronomical sites are therefore located on small islands in the middle of oceans, such
                        as Hawaii and the Canaries, as these small land masses cause little additional turbulence. For
                        the same reason, coastal regions that receive winds predominantly from the direction of the
                        ocean, such as the western coasts of the Americas and Africa, also exhibit excellent seeing.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Altitude</strong></h6>
                    <p>The higher the site of an astronomical observatory, the thinner the atmosphere above the
                        telescope. This reduces <a href="../l01/index.html#extinction">atmospheric extinction</a>, and
                        can also help reduce the seeing if the observatory lies above a turbulent layer in the
                        atmosphere. High-altitude telescopes are also often above the local inversion layer in the
                        atmosphere, meaning that local cloud formation occurs below the telescope, significantly
                        increasing the number of usable nights at the observatory compared to a telescope sited below
                        the inversion level.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Other Factors</strong></h6>
                    <p>Additional factors, such as the difficulty of supplying utilities like water and power,
                        accessibility, humidity and wind speed all play a lesser role in locating professional
                        observatories. For a detailed discussion of many of these factors, see Vik Dhillon's <a
                            href="http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/telescopes/phy217_tel_sites.html">old
                            notes</a>. </p>
                    <p>Political stability is also a factor in the location of large telescopes. This has been a
                        particular issue in recent years, with protests from Native Hawaiians causing <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Meter_Telescope">severe issues</a> for the Thirty

                        cloud cover, low light pollution, good seeing and low humidity. They are all at high altitude

            <h5>Space Based Observatories</h5>
            <p>The factors which degrade astronomical images, such as seeing, sky background, transparency variations
                and extinction are all atmospheric-induced phenomena. These effects can all be removed at a stroke by
                siting optical telescopes in space. The best known example of this is the 2.4 m Hubble Space Telescope
                (HST), which has helped to revolutionise astronomy since 1990 with its diffraction-limited imaging
                capability. Because space-based telescopes don't suffer from atmospheric extinction, HST also allows
                astronomical observations in the UV - impossible from the ground! The main drawback with siting
                telescopes in space is the cost: the HST cost many billions of dollars to build and operate,
                approximately ten times the sum required for the largest ground-based telescopes. </p>
            <p>Another drawback with space is the risk involved in the launch, and the great difficulty of fixing
                problems, servicing the telescope and upgrading the instrumentation once the telescope has been
                deployed. For the HST, servicing missions, which cost nearly $1 billion each, were of limited number and
                were very risky for the astronauts involved. More recent telescopes, such as the JWST, have been located
                much further from Earth and the Sun to keep them cool for as long as possible; servicing missions for
                these telescopes are impossible, so they had better work!</p>

                <h5>Autoguiding</h5>
                <p>We have already seen that telescopes use mounts to track the motion of stars in the sky. In practice,
                    it isn't possible to do this accurately enough for professional work, or even for amateur
                    astrophotography. This is due to mechanical imperfections in the drive systems of the mount, flexure
                    of the mount, and misalignment of equatorial mounts with regard to the celestial pole. </p>
                <p>The result is that stars drift slowly across the field of view, which would cause smearing in long
                    exposures. To get round this, it is necessary to guide telescopes. This is done using an autoguider,
                    a system which monitors the position of a star somewhere in the field of view, and nudges the
                    telescope to keep the guide star locked onto the same pixel on the autoguider's detector.</p>
                <p>There are two main types of autoguiders in use. <strong>Guidescopes</strong> use a separate, smaller
                    telescope to image a wider field of view. The wide field of view means that guide scopes are likely
                    to find a bright star to guide on, but because they are mechanically separate from the main
                    telescope, they can flex relative to the main scope. This means that, even though the guide star is
                    held fixed, the main telescope's view of the sky can drift slowly. <strong>Off-axis guiders</strong>
                    use a mirror on a moveable stage to pick off some light from the main telescope, and focus it on a
                    separate autoguiding camera. This exhibits less flexure than the guidescope method, and is the one
                    most often used for large telescopes. Both designs are shown below in <a href="#figure58">figure 58</a>.</p>

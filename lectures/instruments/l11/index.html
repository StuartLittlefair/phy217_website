                    <p>An astronomical detector is a device, typically located in the focal plane of a telescope or
                        instrument, that has the ability to record the photons incident upon it. For imaging or
                        spectroscopy, a detector composed of a two-dimensional array of <strong>pixels</strong> is
                        essential. Detectors must not waste photons - astronomical objects are faint and millions of
                        pounds are spent on large telescopes to collect as many photons as possible. Throughout history
                        many astronomical detectors have been used; perhaps the most important were the human eye and
                        photographic plates. In 1969, however, Willard Boyle and George Smith invented the
                        <strong>charge-coupled device</strong> or <strong>CCD</strong>, a discovery for which they were
                        awarded a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics. CCDs are small and incredibly efficient,
                        detecting almost all photons incident upon them. Astronomers pioneered the use of CCDs in the
                        1970s and nowadays you would find it extremely difficult to find any other type of detector in
                        use at a major telescope. For this reason, we shall concentrate exclusively on CCDs in this
                        lecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>CCDs are very complex electronic devices, and we shall discuss their operation in a simplified
                        way. For the curious, much more detail on the operation and construction of CCDs is provided in

                    <h5>Semi-conductors</h5>
                    <p>CCDs work by making use of semiconductors; the most common semi-conductor used for CCDs is
                        Silicon. We saw in PHY104 that the energy levels of electrons around single atoms were
                        restricted to discrete energy levels. When isolated atoms are brought together to form a solid,
                        they interact and their energy levels are spread into a large number of closely spaced levels,
                        creating a series of bands, as shown in <a href="#figure69">figure 69</a>, below. </p>
                    <p>At temperatures of absolute zero, the highest energy band that contains electrons is called the
                        <strong>valence band</strong>. Electrons in the valence band are unable to move between atoms in
                        the solid, because nearly all the electron states at this energy are already occupied. The only
                        way an electron can move, and thus conduct electricity is to gain energy. The electron then
                        moves into the <strong>conduction band</strong>. Now there are unoccupied conduction band states
                        available around nearby atoms and the electron can move through the solid.
                    </p>
                    <p>The difference between insulators and metals is explained by the difference in energy between the
                        valence band and the conduction band, known as the <strong>band gap</strong>. In insulators
                        these are very far apart in energy. As a result, there are almost no electrons in the conduction
                        band and the electrical conductivity is poor. In metals, the valence and conduction bands
                        overlap. Even at low temperatures, <strong>thermal excitation</strong> is able to create many
                        conduction band electrons which are free to move through the solid. Metals are good conductors
                        of electricity. Somewhere in between are the <strong>semi-conductors</strong>. Semi-conductors
                        have small band gaps. Thermal excitation of electrons into the conduction band is small (but not
                        zero). However, in a semi-conductor, electrons can be promoted into the conduction band by the
                        <strong>absorption of energy from a photon</strong>. It is this property that allows
                        semi-conductors to be used in CCDs as photon detectors.

                    <h5>CCDs: Principles</h5>
                    <p>
                        All CCDs work via the same basic process. Photons excite electrons into the conduction band.
                        These electrons are free to move through the CCD, and so can be moved to some readout
                        electronics, where we count the number of electrons which have been excited. The number of
                        electrons we count is proportional to the number of photons arriving at the detector. CCDs thus
                        have to perform four jobs:
                    <ol>
                        <li>they must create photo-electrons; </li>
                        <li>they must store photo-electrons in pixels during an exposure; </li>
                        <li>they must move the photo-electrons to the readout electronics;</li>
                        <li>they must count the number of photo-electrons created in each pixel.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Quantum Efficiency</strong></h6>
                    <p>The semi-conductor of choice for CCDs is silicon. It has a large band gap, reducing the
                        importance of thermal excitation. Electrons that are elevated to the conduction band via the
                        absorption of a photon are known as photo-electrons. Not all photons will produce
                        photo-electrons, however. The band gap of Silicon is 1.26 eV. Photons with a lower energy,
                        \(E=h\nu < 1.26\) eV will not create photo-electrons. This means that CCDs based on Silicon can
                            only detect photons with wavelengths shorter than \(\lambda=1100\) nm. Photons with higher
                            energies, e.g. optical photons, can of course produce photo-electrons, but not all do. </p>
                            <p>The quantum efficiency (QE) of a detector is the fraction of incident photons which
                                produce photo-electrons. Through <a
                                    href="http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/detectors/phy217_det_performance.html">clever
                                    design</a>, the QE of CCDs can reach 90% at optical wavelengths. For comparison, the
                                quantum efficiency of photographic film is around 10%, making it easy to see why CCDs
                                have become the dominant detector in optical astronomy.</p>

                    <h5>Charge Coupling</h5>
                    <p>How are the photo-electrons kept within a pixel during the exposure, and how are they moved to
                        the readout electronics at the end of an exposure? The unique feature of CCDs, which give them
                        their name, is the way photo-electrons are moved from the pixel in which they were created - a
                        process known as <strong>charge-coupling</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Once the CCD has been exposed to light for the required amount of time, each pixel will contain a
                        charge packet of size proportional to the number of incident photons. To measure this charge, it
                        is necessary to move these charge packets, one by one, off the chip. The easiest way of
                        visualizing this process is by thinking of taking a CCD image as analogous to measuring the rain
                        falling on a field, as shown in <a href="#figure70">figure 70</a>. The first step is to distribute a large
                        number of buckets in a rectangular pattern of rows and columns over the field - these are the
                        pixels. After it has stopped raining, you can measure the amount of water collected in each
                        bucket, i.e. the amount of charge in each pixel, by shifting the entire array of buckets, one
                        row at a time, on parallel conveyor belts towards a perpendicular conveyor belt at one end of
                        the field. When a single row has been transferred onto the conveyor belt at the end of the
                        field, the row is shifted, one bucket at a time, towards a measuring point at the end of this
                        conveyor belt, where the amount of water in each bucket is recorded. Once the whole row has been
                        measured, the next row is shifted onto the conveyor belt at the end of the field, and the
                        process is repeated until every bucket in the field has been measured. By plotting the amount of
                        rain in each bucket as a two-dimensional grey-scale image, where white represents a full bucket
                        and black an empty one, it is possible to visualise the pattern of rainfall over the field.
                        Replacing the rain in this analogy by photons, this is how an image of the sky can be recorded.

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>How are the conveyor belts implemented electronically? In most CCDs, each pixel has three
                        electrodes attached to it. A large positive voltage applied to one of these electrodes will
                        attract the photo-electrons. We can also think of this voltage as creating a potential well
                        which will fill with photo-electrons. This is the way CCDs keep photo-electrons in a single
                        pixel during an exposure. The three electrodes are also used to move charge between pixels. The
                        voltage in an electrode adjacent to the electrode holding the charge packet is raised to the
                        same level. This allows the charge to flow, like water, and be shared between the two
                        electrodes. Decreasing the voltage of the original electrode then completes the transfer,
                        pushing all of the charge across to the adjacent electrode, which is held at the higher voltage
                        level. Since there are three electrodes in each pixel, three of the above transfers are required
                        to move the charge packet by one pixel. The process of raising and lowering the voltages to move
                        charge is known as clocking, and is illustrated in <a href="#figure71">figure 71</a>.</p>

                    <h5>Readout Electronics</h5>
                    <p>Looking again at <a href="#figure70">figure 70</a>, we can see that rows of pixels are shifted consecutively
                        onto a horizontal serial register, which moves the charge from each pixel, one-by-one into the
                        readout electronics. The job of the readout electronics is to measure the amount of charge
                        collected in each pixel. The readout electronics for a CCD are <a
                            href="http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy217/detectors/phy217_det_output.html">quite
                            complex</a>, but they all operate on the same basic principle. The charge from each pixel,
                        \(Q\), is emptied into a capacitor of capacitance \(C\). This causes a small change in the
                        voltage across the capacitor given by \(V = Q/C\). This analog voltage change can be measured.
                        Finally, the voltage produced by each charge packet is digitized using an
                        <strong>analogue-to-digital converter</strong> (ADC), producing the number of
                        <strong>analogue-to-digital units</strong> (ADUs), or simply counts, in each pixel, which are
                        then written to a computer disk.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Readout Noise</strong></h6>
                    <p>In an ideal world, every photon striking the CCD would produce one electron in a pixel, which
                        would be measured as one count by the ADC. Of course, we do not live in an ideal world. The
                        voltage on the capacitor in the readout electronics is around one microvolt for each electron in
                        the pixel, and this voltage cannot be measured with perfect accuracy. This introduces a
                        <strong>readout noise</strong> in the charge measured in every pixel. In a well designed CCD the
                        readout noise can be as small as 3e- per pixel. This means that, even if every pixel in the CCD
                        actually contained the same number electrons, the measured number of counts would vary by about
                        3e- from pixel to pixel. We will see <a href="../l09/">later</a> that this is quite important
                        for observations of faint astronomical objects.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>Well-depth and Dynamic Range</strong></h6>
                    <p>Each CCD pixel has a maximum charge carrying ability, known as the <strong>full-well
                            capacity</strong>. Typically, the full-well capacity of a pixel is hundreds of thousands of
                        electrons. If more electrons are created, they spill vertically into adjacent pixels (structures
                        in the CCD, known as <strong>channel stops</strong> prevent horizontal leakage). This leakage of
                        charge into adjacent pixels is known as <strong>blooming</strong>, and is shown in <a href="#figure72">figure 72</a>. The full well depth sets an upper limit to how many electrons can be detected
                        by one pixel.</p>
                    <p>At the other end of the scale, the readout noise sets a lower limit to how many electrons each
                        pixel can detect. With a readout noise of 3e-, how do you tell the difference between pixels
                        which store 1, 2 or 3e-? The ratio of the full-well capacity to the readout noise is known as
                        the dynamic range of the CCD, and is typically of order 100,000:1.</p>
                    <h6><strong>Analog-to-digital conversion and Gain</strong></h6>
                    <p>All data from CCDs are stored as digital numbers on a computer disc. That means the analog
                        voltage must be converted to a digital number. Numbers are stored on computers using bits which
                        can either be 0 or 1. A digital number is stored using a given number of bits, using the <a
                            href="http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/courses/CSCI1200-96/binary.html">binary number system</a>.
                        Most high-quality CCDs use 16-bit ADCs. </p>
                    <p>Using one bit, we can represent two numbers - 0 and 1. Using 2 bits, four numbers (0, 1, 2 and 3)
                        can be written. A 16-bit ADC can represent 216 different numbers, from 0 to 65,535. Each of
                        these numbers is one ADU, or a count, so the ADC can represent values from 0 counts, to 65,535
                        counts. However, <em>each count does not have to represent one electron</em>. Instead, we are
                        free to choose the relationship between ADU and e-s. This is controlled by a parameter known as
                        the gain, often given in units of e-/ADU.</p>
                    <p>Choosing the correct gain is important. For example, suppose the readout noise in a CCD is 2e-.
                        If we set the gain to 4e-/ADU then pixels containing 0, 1, 2 or 3 e-s will all be measured as 0
                        ADU. By choosing a gain of 4e-/ADU we have introduced a rounding error; we have effectively
                        added more noise, known as <strong>quantization noise</strong>. If we use a lower gain of 1
                        e-/ADU, the noise on each pixel is set by the readout noise, which is desirable in astronomy
                        when many pixels will record small numbers of photons. </p>
                    <h6><strong>Saturation</strong></h6>
                    <p>One consequence of using low gains to reduce quantization noise, however, is that the dynamic
                        range of the CCD is defined not by the full-well capacity of a pixel but by the limits of the
                        ADC. For example, a gain of 1.5 e-/ADU would mean that a 16-bit ADC is capable of counting 1.5 x
                        65535 = 98302 e- before running out of numbers to record higher pixel charges. We say that such
                        a pixel is saturated. If the full-well capacity of the pixel is 200,000 e-, this means that the
                        ADC would saturate well before the full-well capacity of the pixel is reached, i.e. the maximum
                        number of electrons that can be counted is 98302, not 200,000. Obviously, a saturated pixel is
                        not capable of accurately recording the amount of photons incident upon it.</p>

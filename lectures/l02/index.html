                    <p>In the previous lectures we have seen how light arrives at our telescopes, but how do telescopes
                        work to create an image? In the next block of lectures we're going to look at telescopes - how
                        they work, and the pros and cons of different telescope designs. Telescopes are vital to
                        astronomy, as they fulfil two roles:
                    <ol>
                        <li>they allow the collection of light over a much larger area, so that faint objects can be
                            studied,</li>
                        <li>they provide higher angular resolution, allowing studies in greater spatial detail.</li>
                    </ol>
                    All telescope designs share certain basic principles of operations. We start with those principles.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Basic Principles</h5>
                    <p><a href="#figure34">Figure 34</a> shows a schematic of a telescope. On the left, light from two
                        distant
                        sources arrives at the telescope. As all astronomical sources are effectively at an infinite
                        distance compared to the dimensions of a telescope, the rays from each source can be assumed to
                        be parallel.</p>

                    <p id="focal_length">The light is collected by an aperture of diameter \(D\) which forms an image of
                        the two sources
                        at the focal plane. The line through the centre of the aperture and the focal plane, and
                        orthogonal to them, defines the optical axis of the system. Since the sources are at infinity,
                        the focal length, \(F\), of the telescope is defined by the distance between the focal plane and
                        the aperture. In astronomical telescopes, the aperture is usually a lens or a mirror, and is
                        circular, hence the amount of light collected is proportional to \(D^2\).</p>

                    <p>The aperture diameter is the single most important parameter affecting the performance of a
                        telescope and hence most telescopes are usually referred to in terms of it, e.g. the ESO 3.6m
                        telescope in Chile, where the 3.6m is the diameter of its primary mirror.</p>

The 'aperture' in the figure represents an optical element, such as a mirror or lens, with the ability to bring light to a focus. Light rays from two objects, separated by an angle \(\theta\) on the sky, are shown. Notice how the image in the focal plane is upside down.</figcaption></figure>

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>From <a href="#figure34">figure 34</a>, we can define two terms which are important for describing the
                        specifications of a telescope.</p>
                    <h6 id="platescale"><strong>Platescale</strong></h6>
                    <p>The plate scale, \(p\) relates the size of the image in the focal plane, \(s\), to it's angular
                        size on the sky, \(\theta\). Given that \(\theta\) is usually small, we can apply the small
                        angle approximation. Figure 34 shows that \(s\) and \(\theta\) are related by:
                        \[ s=F \theta, \] where \(\theta\) is measured in radians. If we want to study an object with
                        angular size \(\theta\) in high spatial detail, then \(s\) needs to be large. Therefore \(F\)
                        needs to be large; we require a telescope with a long focal length.</p>
                    <p>The plate scale is the ratio between the angular size and the image size. In other words, \(p =
                        \theta / s \). Since \(s=F \theta\), it follows that \(p = 1/F. \) Since we have used the small
                        angle approximation, if \(F\) is measured in mm, this is the plate scale in radians per mm. It
                        is more usual to quote the plate scale in arc seconds per mm. Since there is 206265 arc seconds
                        in one radian, the plate scale in arc seconds per mm is given by
                        \[p = 206265/F,\] where \(F\) is measured in mm.</p>
                    <h6 id="focal_ratio"><strong>Focal ratio</strong></h6>
                    <p>The focal ratio \(f\) is defined as the ratio of the focal length to the diameter, i.e \(f =
                        F/D\). The focal ratio is often used to describe the speed of a telescope (it is used in
                        photography the same way). this can be understood as follows. If we fix \(F\), the image scale
                        \(s\) remains the same. For a smaller \(D\), less light is spread over the same area; the image
                        gets dimmer. We would have to expose for longer to get the same amount of light in a given area.
                        Therefore, large values of \(f\) imply slow telescopes, and vice-versa.</p>

                    <h5>Refractors</h5>
                    <p>The refracting telescope was the first type of telescope to be developed. The question of who
                        invented the telescope is a controversial one. It is usually credited to the Dutch optician Hans
                        Lippershey in 1608, although recent research suggests that a form of telescope may have been
                        discovered by the Englishman Leonard Digges around 1550. The first person to systematically use
                        a telescope for astronomy was the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1610, however others were
                        close behind, and the Englishman <a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/harriot.html">Thomas
                            Harriot</a> was the first to record a telescopic observation of the Moon, and Sunspots. </p>
                    <p>The refractor focuses light using a lens, known as the objective. The objective is usually made
                        of glass and, in it's simplest form, has a bi-convex shape where both surfaces are sections of a
                        sphere. The lens collects the parallel light from an astronomical source and forms an image of
                        it, as shown in <a href="#figure35">figure 35</a>. This figure also shows that a simple refractor has
                        a major defect, known as chromatic aberration. This aberration is the largest imperfection to
                        affect astronomical telescopes. </p>

                <div class="media-object-section">
                    <p>Chromatic aberration arises because the glasses used to make lenses typically have refractive
                        indices which decrease as the wavelength of light increases, resulting in the focal length of
                        the objective increasing as the wavelength increases. Hence there is no single focal plane in
                        which light of all wavelengths from a star is in focus, as shown in <a href="#figure35">figure 35</a>.
                        Moving the focal plane towards the lens will provide a point-like blue image surrounded by a red
                        halo. Similarly, moving the focal plane away from the lens will result in a point-like red image
                        surrounded by a blue halo, as shown in <a href="#figure36">figure 36</a>. A compromise can be
                        reached by moving the focal plane to the circle of least confusion, as shown in
                        <a href="#figure35">figure 35</a>. This is still a poor image, and clever design is needed to improve
                        the refractor.</p>

                    <p>In 1758, the English optician John Dolland patented the achromatic doublet (or achromat). The
                        achromat corrects for chromatic aberration by using two lenses made of different materials,
                        typically crown and flint glass. The positive crown-glass lens strongly converges the light, but
                        introduces strong chromatic aberration. The flint glass element is negative. It has a weak
                        refractive index, so it does not undo the convergent effect of the crown glass element. However,
                        the refractive index of flint glass changes rapidly with wavelength, and so it has a stronger
                        effect on the blue light, thus correcting chromatic aberration. The situation is shown
                        schematically in <a href="#figure37">figure 37</a>.</p>

                <div class="cell">
                    <p>An achromatic doublet can only make the focus the same for two wavelengths and there is residual
                        chromatic aberration at intermediate wavelengths. Nevertheless, achromats deliver
                        order-of-magnitude reductions in chromatic aberration. Further improvement is possible by adding
                        a third lens. These are called <em>apochromats</em>, and they can bring three wavelengths (e.g.
                        red, green and blue) to the same focus. Even greater improvements can be obtained by adding more
                        lenses, so-called <em>super-apochromats</em>, but these become economically unviable for the
                        large apertures required for telescope objectives.</p>

                    <h5>Refractors: Pros & Cons</h5>
                    <p>Since apochromats use flint glass to undo some of the convergent effects of the crown glass
                        element, one implication of using achromats to minimise aberrations is that the <a
                            href="#focal_length">focal length</a> becomes quite long. This makes refractors slow, with
                        <a href="#focal_ratio">focal ratios</a> around 10 to 20. The <a href="#platescale">plate
                            scale</a> is therefore quite small, which spreads the image of a point source over a large
                        area in the focal plane. This makes refractors a poor choice for faint objects, but ideal for
                        planetary observations and astrometry (i.e. measuring the positions of stars).
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the biggest issues with refractors is their practicality as we move to larger telescopes.
                        The lens in a refractor has to be held by its edge, and as the lens becomes larger it starts
                        sagging under its own weight and hence distorts the image; second, as the diameter of the lens
                        increases, so does its thickness and thus so does the amount of light absorbed in the glass. As
                        a result, the largest refractor currently in existence is the 40-inch (1m) telescope at Yerkes
                        Observatory near Chicago, built in 1897. <a href="#figure38">Figure 38</a> shows the immense scale of
                        the telescope tube and dome - it is unlikely that a bigger refractor will ever be built.</p>
                    <p>Because of the immense challenge in building large refractors, most professional telescopes are
                        reflecting telescopes.</p>

                    <h5>Using Mirrors</h5>
                    <p>Chromatic aberration is the most serious aberration that affects any optical telescope. It is,
                        however, easily avoided. Reflecting telescopes use mirrors to collect and focus light. Since
                        these rely on reflection, and not refraction, they are free from chromatic aberration. Mirrors
                        are also simpler than lenses in that they only have a single optical surface. Mirrors are
                        usually made of a rigid, hard (i.e. polishable) material with a low thermal expansion
                        coefficient (such as the glass Pyrex), and coated with a thin layer of aluminium, silver or gold
                        to give high reflectivity. A telescope which uses a mirror to collect and focus light is known
                        as a reflector.</p>
                    <p id="spherical">Reflectors, are not aberration free, however. The easiest mirror to make is a
                        spherical mirror. <a href="#figure39">Figure 39</a> shows that the rays from the edge of a
                        spherical mirror come to a focus nearer the mirror than do rays from the centre of the mirror,
                        causing a point source to be imaged as a blurred disc. This defect is known as spherical
                        aberration.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Spherical Aberration and Parabolic Mirrors</strong></h6>
                    <p>
                        The effects of spherical aberration in mirrors can be reduced by positioning the focal plane
                        coincident with the circle of least confusion, as shown in <a href="#figure39">figure 39</a>, but
                        this still leaves an unsatisfactory blurring of the image. However, the Scottish astronomer
                        James Gregory realised in 1663 that spherical aberration can be eliminated if the curve of the
                        surface of a mirror is a parabola. This is also shown in <a href="#figure39">figure 39</a>, where
                        all on-axis rays parallel to the axis of a parabolic mirror are reflected to meet at the <a
                            href="http://www.physicsinsights.org/parabola_focus.html">focus of the parabola</a>.</p>
                    <p>Creating mirrors with parabolic surfaces is not straightforward, as special grinding and
                        polishing techniques are required in order to create the deeper central depression of a parabola
                        compared to a spherical surface. A famous example of spherical aberration is given by the Hubble
                        Space Telescope (HST), which suffered from spherical aberration due to a mistake during the
                        manufacture of its (hyperbolic) 2.4m mirror, as shown in <a href="#figure40">figure 40</a>.
                        Corrective
                        optics were later installed by astronauts on a space shuttle servicing mission and the telescope
                        is now functioning perfectly.</p>

                    <p>It should be noted that lenses, and hence refractors, suffer from spherical aberration in exactly
                        the same way as mirrors, but it is a much smaller effect than chromatic aberration. Spherical
                        aberration can be eliminated from refractors using aspheric lenses, in which the curvature of
                        the surfaces is not constant, but these are difficult and expensive to produce. It is more
                        common to remove spherical aberration from refractors by designing achromats in such a way that
                        the negative lens cancels out the spherical aberration introduced by the positive lens, whilst
                        still correcting for chromatic aberration.</p>

                    <h5>Off-Axis Aberrations</h5>
                    <p>Parabolic mirrors only bring on-axis light to a single point of focus. In <a href="#figure41">figure 41</a>, we see what happens when off-axis sources are imaged using a
                        parabolic mirror. We can see that the light is not brought to a well-defined focus, thus
                        producing off-axis aberrations. Note that these aberrations are not unique to parabolic mirrors:
                        refractors and spherical mirrors suffer from them too. Due to their nature, off-axis aberrations
                        affect objects imaged at the edges of the field of view.</p>

The ellipse should turn into a circle and then into an ellipse again on the other side of the best focus, but with its major axis rotated by 90o. It is important not to confuse this aberration, which affects only off-axis images, with the eye defect of the same name, which affects the entire field of vision and is due to a misshapen eye lens.</figcaption></figure>

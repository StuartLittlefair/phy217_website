                <div class="cell">
                    <p>The vast majority of astronomical sources emit photons at random. Therefore, when these photons
                        reach our telescope, they are randomly spaced. Consider the situation shown in <a href="#figure105">figure 105</a>. <strong>On average</strong>, this source is emitting 4 photons per second,
                        but they are randomly spaced. Therefore, in any given 1s exposure, we will not detect exactly 4
                        photons. Suppose we turn the problem around, and in a 1s exposure we detect 7 photons (as we do
                        in the time interval t=1-2s in <a href="#figure105">figure 105</a> above). This <strong>does
                            not</strong> mean the source emits 7 photons/sec on average. This random bunching of photons
                        introduces noise into our measurements of stellar flux. This variation is known as <strong>shot
                            noise</strong>. It represents the irreducible minimum level of noise present in an
                        astronomical observation.</p>
                    <p>If the number of photons received in a fixed interval of time has an average value \(N\), but the
                        photons are randomly spaced, the probability of detecting \(k\) photons in the fixed time
                        interval is given by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson
                            distribution</a>,
                        \[P(k) = \frac{N^k e^{-N}}{k!}.\]
                        In astronomy, we are often dealing with large \(N\), and for large N (i.e \(N \gtrsim 5\)) the
                        Poisson distribution tends towards our old favourite, the Gaussian distribution, with a mean of
                        \(N\), and a standard deviation of \(\sigma = \sqrt{N}\),
                        \[P(k) = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2} } e^{-(k-N)^2/2\sigma^2}.\]
                        Therefore, if we detect \(N\) photons per second from an astronomical source, the best we can do
                        is to say that the true mean photon rate from the star has a likely mean of \(N\), and an
                        uncertainty of \(\sqrt{N}\). However, it is vital to note that this conclusion does not just
                        apply to photons from stars, but to any process when we are counting random events which occur
                        at an average rate. For example, it applies equally to the counting of photons from the sky (i.e
                        <a href="../../principles/l01/#transparency">sky background</a>), or the production of
                        thermally-generated electrons in a semi-conductor (i.e. dark current).
                    </p>
                    <p>For a perfect astronomical detector in space, this shot noise would set a limit on the accuracy
                        with which we could measure the photon rate. We would say the noise on the measurement would be
                        \(\sqrt{N}\).</p>

                    <h5>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h5>
                    <p>A crucial quantity for astronomical observations is the ratio of the signal from an astronomical
                        source, \(S\), to the noise, \(N\). The signal-to-noise ratio, is given by
                        \[{\rm SNR} = S/N.\]
                        For example, if we measure 100 photons from a star (\(S\)), the shot noise (\(N\)) is 10 photons
                        and we would have a SNR=10. We might also say the noise is one tenth of the signal, or that the
                        error bar on the flux is 10% of the total flux. The SNR thus sets the accuracy with which the
                        flux can be measured.</p>
                    <p>The "signal" part of the signal-to-noise ratio doesn't always refer to the flux of the star. For
                        example, if we were trying to measure the variability of a star, the "signal" part could refer
                        to the amplitude of variability. Suppose, for example, the variability of the star is 20% of the
                        mean flux. If the noise in our flux measurements is 4% of the mean flux, then the variability is
                        measured with a signal-to-noise ratio given by
                        \[ {\rm SNR} = 20/4 = 5.\]
                        This is shown in <a href="#figure106">figure 106</a>.</p>

                    <h5>The CCD Signal-to-Noise Equation</h5>

                    <p>For CCD observations there are several sources of noise. Suppose the number of photo-electrons
                        detected from the object, sky background and dark current are \(S_o, S_s\) and \(S_d\),
                        respectively. Then the various noise sources, and their amplitudes (standard deviations) are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>shot-noise in the detected photo-electrons from the source, \(\sqrt{S_o}\);</li>
                        <li>shot-noise in the detected photo-electrons from the sky background, \(\sqrt{S_s}\);</li>
                        <li>shot-noise in the thermally excited electrons, i.e the dark current, \(\sqrt{S_d}\);</li>
                        <li>time-independent readout noise, \(R\). Note there is no square root here. The readout noise
                            is the standard deviation in the number of electrons measure - it is not a Poissonian
                            counting process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    It is extremely important to realise that these noise sources are present even after the mean sky
                    background or dark current has been subtracted. The measured value of any CCD pixel differs from
                    it's true value by some <strong>unknown</strong> amount due to noise. The values above tell us
                    the typical size of this unknown noise, but not it's exact value. Subtracting the sky during <a
                        href="../../principles/l02/">photometry</a>, or <a
                        href="../../instruments/p13/#dark">subtracting
                        dark frames</a>
                    does not remove the shot noise from the CCD pixels!
                    </p>

                    <p>We can assume all the noise sources are independent. When we add Gaussian random variables, the
                        variance \(\sigma_T^2\) of the result is equal to the <a
                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_normally_distributed_random_variables">sum of the
                            variances</a> of each Gaussian, \(\sigma^2_T = \Sigma_i^n \sigma^2_i\) . The total noise,
                        \(N\), is equal to the standard deviation \(\sigma_T\), and is therefore given by:
                        \[N = \sqrt{S_o + S_s + S_d + R^2}.\]
                        Hence, the SNR is given by
                        \[{\rm SNR} = S_o/N = \frac{S_o}{\sqrt{S_o + S_s + S_d + R^2}}.\]</p>

                    <h6><strong>CCD equation in units of counts (ADU)</strong></h6>
                    <p>Typically, when predicting the SNR of a CCD observation we have the following quantities to hand:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\(S_o\), in units of photons per second;</li>
                        <li>\(S_s\), in units of photons per second per pixel;</li>
                        <li>\(S_d\), in units of electrons per second per pixel;</li>
                        <li>\(R\), in units of electrons per pixel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>A few things are worthy of comment in the above list. First, \(S_o\) is the total number of
                        photons from the object, which will probably be spread out over a number of pixels, whereas
                        \(S_s\) is the number of sky photons per pixel. Second, \(S_o\) and \(S_s\) are in photon units
                        not electrons. Third, \(S_o\), \(S_s\) and \(S_d\) will increase with exposure time, but \(R\)
                        will not.</p>
                    <p>We need to use electrons in the SNR equation above, not the number of photons emitted by the
                        source. Poissonian statistics apply to whatever we are counting, and in this case we are
                        counting electrons! The total number of electrons detected from the source is given by
                        \[S_o Qt,\]
                        where \(t\) is the exposure time in seconds, and \(Q\) is the Quantum efficiency of the CCD,
                        expressed as a number between 0 and 1. Similarly, the total number of electrons detected from
                        the sky is
                        \[S_s Qt n_p,\]
                        where \(n_p\) is the number of pixels that the object is spread over. Using similar arguments
                        for the other terms, the CCD SNR equation is written as
                        \[{\rm SNR} = \frac{S_o Qt}{ \sqrt{ S_o Qt + S_s Qt n_p + S_d t n_p + R^2 n_p } }.\]</p>
                    <p>Sometimes \(S_o\) and \(S_s\) will be in different units - astronomers do like to be awkward,
                        after all. We always need to convert them to units of electrons, as electrons are the thing
                        that's actually being counted, and thus obeys Poissonian statistics. With \(S_o\) and \(S_s\) in
                        photons, we converted to electrons using the QE. If \(S_o\) and \(S_s\) are given in counts, we
                        convert from counts to electrons by using the CCD gain \(G\) in place of the QE \(Q\). The SNR
                        CCD equation becomes
                        \[{\rm SNR} = \frac{S_o Gt}{ \sqrt{ S_o Gt + S_s Gt n_p + S_d t n_p + R^2 n_p } }.\]
                        Finally, one might also find \(S_o\) and \(S_s\) given in flux units. In that case we divide the
                        flux by the average energy of a single photon in this bandpass to find the number of photons
                        arriving per second, and then use the QE \(Q\) to convert to electrons per second.</p>

                    <h6><strong>Limiting Cases</strong></h6>
                    <p>There are three limiting cases for the CCD SNR equation. Using the simplified form \({\rm SNR} =
                        S_o / \sqrt{S_o + S_d + S_s + R^2}\), we find that the these limiting cases are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Object Limited</strong> - \(S_o\) is much greater than \(S_s\), \(S_d\) and \(R^2\).
                            In this case \[{\rm SNR} = S_o / \sqrt{S_o} = \sqrt{S_o}.\] Since \(S_o \propto t\), this
                            means that \({\rm SNR} \propto \sqrt t\). In addition, \(S_o \propto D^2\), where \(D\) is
                            the telescope aperture. Therefore \({\rm SNR} \propto D\).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Background Limited</strong> - \(S_s\) is much greater than \(S_o\), \(S_d\) and
                            \(R^2\). In this case \[{\rm SNR} = S_o / \sqrt{S_s}.\] In this case, since both \(S_s\) and
                            \(S_o\) scale the same way with exposure time and telescope aperture, the SNR scales with
                            respect to these values in the same way as the object limited case. For a fixed \(S_o\), the
                            SNR scales with the square root of the sky signal \(S_s\). It is therefore very important to
                            observe faint sources when the sky is faint. Scattered light from the from the Moon is a
                            major source of sky background, so faint sources should be observed near new Moon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Read Noise Limited</strong> - \(R^2\) is much greater than \(S_s\), \(S_o\) and
                            \(S_d\). Since all these quantities scale with exposure time, but \(R\) does not, short
                            exposures are often read noise limited. In this case \[{\rm SNR} = S_o / R.\] Since the
                            readout noise is independent of integration time or telescope aperture, the SNR will now
                            increase linearly with exposure time and as the square of the telescope aperture diameter.
                        </li>
